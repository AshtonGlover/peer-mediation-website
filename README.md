# peer-mediation-website

This is the official website for the Clover High School Peer Mediation club. It utilizes a TypeScript / React frontend with a Java Spring Boot backend. There are two ways to access the site, either as an admin (club member) or as a student user who seeks to chat with a club member. Admin access is restricted by a confidental username and password, and only students with a Clover School District email can login. Upon accessing the site, student users will be taken to an about us page where they can read about the club, and there will also be an option to chat. In this chat page, they can send messages which will be accessible with time stamps on the admin's end. All chat history is stored in Google Firestore in order to ensure that chat history will persist upon signing out. The backend is hosted through AWS Elastic Beanstalk, and the frontend is hosted thorugh GitHub pages.
